        <h2 class="about-me">About me</h2>
        <img class="my-photo" src="images/Oswell.jpeg" alt="photo-of-oswell" />
        <p>
          I am a dedicated and solutions-oriented Mechanical Engineer with a
          Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of
          Mines and Technology (UMaT) in Tarkwa, Ghana. My core expertise lies
          in the design, analysis, and optimization of complex mechanical
          systems, with a specialized focus on heating, ventilation, and air
          conditioning (HVAC) systems, thermal dynamics, and fluid mechanics. I
          am proficient in utilizing advanced modeling and simulation software
          to create efficient, sustainable, and code-compliant designs that meet
          rigorous performance standards and client specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complementing my technical engineering foundation, I have fortified my
          skill set with a formal project management certification from
          BYU-Pathway Ensign College. This program provided me with a robust
          framework in Agile Project Management, Advanced Project Management
          methodologies, Supply Chain Management, and Quality Management. This
          unique combination of deep technical knowledge and managerial acumen
          allows me to bridge the critical gap between theoretical design and
          practical execution. I am equipped to not only develop innovative
          engineering solutions but also to oversee projects from conception
          through to completion, ensuring they are delivered on time, within
          budget, and to the highest quality benchmarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond traditional engineering, I possess a strong passion for
          computational problem-solving and data analysis. I am highly
          proficient in a suite of programming languages and engineering
          software tools, and I derive significant satisfaction from leveraging
          technology to streamline processes and enhance productivity. Microsoft
          Excel, in particular, is a tool I have mastered; I consistently use
          its advanced functionalities to model complex scenarios, automate
          workflows, and perform intricate data analysis, making it an
          indispensable asset in my problem-solving toolkit.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional ethos is deeply rooted in a commitment to lifelong
          learning, leadership, and service. My experience as a full-time
          missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the
          Nigeria Calabar Mission was formative, instilling in me a profound
          sense of discipline, cultural awareness, and a dedication to serving
          others. These values seamlessly translate into my professional life,
          where I strive to lead with integrity, foster collaborative
          environments, and contribute meaningfully to every team I join.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a devoted husband and father of two, I am driven by a profound
          sense of responsibility and a desire to build a better future through
          engineering excellence. I am continuously seeking to apply my
          integrated knowledge of mechanical systems, project management, and
          data-driven analysis to develop impactful, innovative, and sustainable
          solutions that address real-world challenges.
